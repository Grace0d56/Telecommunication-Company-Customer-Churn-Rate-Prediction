# Telecommunication-Company-Customer-Churn-Rate-Prediction
This project involves predicting customer churn rates for Expresso Telecom using various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Stacking Ensemble methods. Members include JyunRu Huang, Kayla Huang, Ruorong Wang, and myself. 

We focused on identifying key factors influencing customer churn and developed predictive models to efficiently detect customers likely to leave the service. Particular attention was given to improving the recall rate to ensure the identification of most at-risk customers, allowing for proactive retention efforts.

Through extensive exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model stacking, we achieved robust predictive performance. Our analysis highlighted that customer tenure and service usage frequency significantly impact churn decisions. Recommendations include focusing on high-recall models to effectively target retention strategies, leveraging direct customer feedback, and implementing time series analysis for enhanced churn prediction accuracy.

The insights derived from this analysis can help telecom companies optimize resource allocation for customer retention and reduce churn rates effectively.
